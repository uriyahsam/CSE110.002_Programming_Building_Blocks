# Word Puzzle Game: Final Version with Creativity
# ----------------------------------------------------
# This program is a word puzzle game where the user tries to guess a secret word.
# Features of the program:
# 1. A random secret word is chosen from a predefined list.
# 2. The user is prompted to guess the word, and hints are provided after each guess.
# 3. The hint shows:
#    - Letters in the correct position (uppercase).
#    - Letters present in the secret word but in the wrong position (lowercase).
#    - Letters not in the secret word (underscore '_').
# 4. If the guess has a different length than the secret word, the program informs the user without providing a hint.
# 5. The game ends when the user guesses the word or runs out of a limited number of guesses.
#
# Creativity Added:
# - Random selection of the secret word from a list of words for replayability.
# - A maximum number of guesses (10) to increase challenge and urgency.
# - Visual feedback using emojis for success (ðŸŽ‰) and failure (ðŸ’€).
# - Hints are displayed with spaces and capitalization for better readability.
